## Summary
Tempo-Tear is a 2D Hack 'N' Slash Rhythm Game where players slice enemies to the beat of the music. However, players are unable to move from where they stand. Instead, they use their mouse to actively strike down foes who stand to kill the Vibe. 

## Run-Instructions

## Objective 
Players must survive the on-slaught of enemies in various levels and obtain the high-score!

## How to Play
### Player
Players are situated in the centre of the screen in company with the beat-marker. 
Their health bar can be found in the top left of the screen.

### Enemies
Various enemies will approach from both sides of the screen alongside their slash-pattern.
As enemies approach, beat-indicators will appear and move in sync with the enemy's movement towards the beat-marker.

### Attacking
In order to attack, players will draw slash-patterns corresponding to the enemy they want to hit with the stroke of their mouse.
To initiate a slash, hold down LMB while moving the mouse in the desired direction. Once finished, simply let go of LMB.

For enemies that have multiple slash-patterns, players have to draw each pattern individually.

### Scoring & Multipliers
Points are awarded for every enemy striken down. However, the closer the beat-indicator is to the beat-marker, the more points are awarded.
The score multiplier increases for every enemy striken down enemy in succession. If the player gets hit, the multiplier will reset. 
Both elements can be found in the top right corner of the screen.
